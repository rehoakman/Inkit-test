Make sure you launch the backend first before trying to pull data onto the frontend. Continue reading the instructions to launch the backend properly.
Start by chaning your directory into the backend folder
Then you must get module dependencies with the following command: pip install fastapi python-dateutil uvicorn
After installing the modules to run the web server, type the following into your terminal: backend:app
if that doesn't work you could try doing backend:app --reload
